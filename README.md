# **My Portfolio Website!**

## <ins>Summary</ins>

This is my portfolio website built using Next.js, JavaScript, Framer Motion, and Tailwind CSS.

The purpose of this project was to build a visually appealing and responsive portfolio using that tech stack.

It has different components, motion animations, a theme switcher, and different styling to make it responsive.
